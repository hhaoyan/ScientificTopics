In conclusion, we have demonstrated a novel example of multicomponent spontaneous optical resolution by taking advantage of the stereochemical hermaphroditism of a D2-symmetric saddle-shaped chiral porphyrin 1. The unique stereochemical regulation owing to the hermaphroditic character of 1 substantially decreases the complexity of the crystallization event involving two or three chiral compounds. The hermaphroditic chirality reported herein will give new insight into chiral recognition. Application of the resulting porous cocrystal with a helical element to photosensitized asymmetric catalysis may be an interesting subject worthy of further investigation.
Table 17 compares the predicted and the published values of the purchased equipment cost of each one of the piece of equipments. Despite the fact that the cost equations used in this work are different to those used in Fisher et al., the predicted values are in good agreement. It should be noted that the total purchased equipment cost reported by Fisher et al. is 76.379 million US$ if the costs involved by the cooling tower, filtration, CO2 compressor separator, reflux accumulator and pumps are not considered. Also, Table 17 clearly shows that the purchased costs estimated by Fisher et al. increased 25.0% from 2005 to 2011.
The ethanolamine ammonia lyase dependent rearrangement of aminoethanol has not been the subject of theoretical studies so far. In the present computational investigation, several mechanistic scenarios will be addressed including the concept of partial protonation of the substrate. The latter mode of operation is supported by the finding that in several B12-dependent enzymes the amino acid sequence of the enzyme active site contains Asp and His residues, which might serve as proton donors. In the case of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase catalyzed rearrangement, it was concluded that His plays a role of a proton donor. From the aminoethanol acidity (pKa &equals; 9.45 for the conjugate acid of 1), one can expect partial, if not complete, protonation of the aminoethanol substrate embedded in the enzyme's active site.
New insights into the effects of spinodal decomposition on the recombination efficiency have been obtained from recent studies of nanowires. Murotani et al. studied GaInN nanowires grown by MBE over a wide range of InN concentrations. They reported that as the InN content increased, carrier localization was observed and that the localization energy, due to the reduction in bandgap in the high-In clusters formed due to spinodal decomposition, increased. Very significantly, this resulted in high internal quantum efficiencies across the entire range of InN concentrations. This is a very interesting approach for the fabrication of LEDs covering the entire visible spectrum, potentially solving the “green gap” problem.
The high affinity of GroEL for GroES in ATP revealed by the study of hydrolysis-defective D398A mutants suggested that, under normal conditions, the cis ring must undergo hydrolysis of bound ATP before ATP in the trans ring can trigger GroES release. The ADP-bound state presumably comprises a lower-affinity GroEL–GroES interaction, or is more responsive to a signal for release of GroES produced by the trans ring. To test this, we produced a mixed-ring GroEL assembly21, composed of a D398A ring, which was able to bind polypeptide and GroES but unable to hydrolyse ATP, and a 203/337/349 (3-7-9) ring, which was unable to bind substrate or GroES but able to provide normal ATP function in trans to the D398A ring (see Fig. 3a). The mixed-ring complex, MR2, was tested for ability to stably bind 35S-labelled GroES in ATP or ADP. In the presence of ATP, MR2 stably bound GroES, failing to release it even though there was hydrolysis in the 3-7-9 ring (at a rate ∼21% of wild-type, unaffected by GroES). In particular, when SR398 was added as a GroES ‘trap’ to a mixture containing MR2–GroES and ATP, no transfer of radiolabelled GroES from MR2 to SR398 was observed by gel-filtration analysis (Fig. 3b). Thus the high affinity for GroES of the D398A ring of MR2 in ATP seems to recapitulate that observed with SR398 in ATP. GroES was also stably bound to MR2 in ADP, although if ADP was absent from the gel filtration running buffer, the GroES was released (data not shown). This would seem to be consistent with an apparently lower affinity interaction of GroES with the D398A ring in ADP (compared with no release from the ATP complex when it was gel filtered in the absence of nucleotide). More importantly, however, when the MR2–GroES complex formed in ADP was exposed to ATP, GroES was released efficiently, and was detected through its capture by co-incubated SR398 (Fig. 3b). This suggests that the pre-bound ADP cis complex emulates the post-hydrolysis ADP cis complex in being similarly coupled to the action of trans-sided ATP, allowing GroES to be released.
To investigate the role of the Pro residue in the bitter taste of peptides, synthesized some oligopeptides containing Pro and evaluated their tastes. Pro peptides exhibited bitterness. The most significant role of the Pro residue in peptide bitterness was dependent on the conformational alternation of the peptide molecule by folding the peptide skeleton due to the imino ring of the Pro molecule. They concluded that two bitter taste determinant sites were essential for peptide bitterness and should be adjacent in the steric conformation of the peptides. synthesized some oligopeptides containing Phe or Tyr and evaluated their taste. The hydrophobicity of Phe or Tyr molecule caused the marked bitter taste in peptides. The bitterness was more intense when Phe was located at the C-terminus and when the content of Phe or Tyr was increased in peptides. The hydrophobicity of Leu residues markedly caused the bitterness of peptides. Bitterness was always found when a Leu residue was located at the C-terminus of peptides . examined the bitterness of diastereomers of a hexapeptide (Arg-Arg-Pro-Pro-Phe-Phe) containing d-Phe in place of l-Phe. The analogs with l-Phe at the C-terminal exhibited stronger bitterness than those with d-Phe at the C-terminal. Evidently, the configuration of the C-terminal hydrophobic amino acid is important for the increase in bitterness. synthesized a bitter heptapeptide, Gly-Pro-Phe-Pro-Ile-Ile-Val, and found it to be indistinguishable from a natural peptide isolated from a tryptic hydrolyzate of Hammersten casein. synthesized Arg-Gly-Pro-X-Pro-Ile-Ile-Val (I, X-Phe) and analog I (X=d-Phe, Lys, Gly, Glu, or l-Phe) in order to elucidate the relationship between the chemical structure and bitter taste of the C-terminal portion of β-CN. The location of the hydrophobic amino acid with the l-configuration between the two Pro residues was shown to be important for this series of peptides in order to produce strong bitterness. synthesized and tasted several O-aminoacyl sugars, in which amino acids or peptides were attached to the 2- and 3-position of methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside in order to study the role of hydrophobicity in bitter peptides. The bitterness increased as the hydrophobicity increased, implying that the bitterness receptor recognizes the hydrophobicity of bitter peptides.
Membrane fabrication and pattern reproducibility were analyzed by qualitative and quantitative observations using SEM, atomic force microscopy (AFM; Molecular Force Probe (MFP-3D), Asylum Research, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) and profilometry. In order to assess the structural integrity and stability of the membranes, nanoindentation and swelling tests under different environmental conditions were conducted. Furthermore, membranes were sutured in dry and hydrated conditions in order to demonstrate their manipulability. In addition, assessment of membrane biocompatibility, bioactivity through signaling from the RGDS sequence and topographical effects on cell morphology was performed by in vitro culture of rMSCs.
Requirements for pellet injection system for a Japanese DEMO concept are comprehensively assessed in order to elucidate direction and target of R&D. A fusion output control simulation study using 1.5D transport code is carried out to estimate requirement of fuel particle source. Next, multivariable parameter dependence survey of the fuel deposition source on pellet speed, poloidal injection angle, pellet mass and pedestal height is performed. The conditions to achieve the target fueling depth derived from the output control study are shown. The AUG calibrated relation is referred to consider spatial restriction of tokamak geometry which relates maximum pellet velocity to curvature of pellet guide tube. Then the restriction is collated to the results of multivariable survey to find the most advantageous pellet speed, injection angle, and pellet mass which is consistent with both output control and tokamak geometry. Consequently, a conceptual design of fuel pellet injection system as the R&D target toward to DEMO is proposed.
Isolation frequencies of R. aquatilis (630/1,088), S. liquefaciens (135/1,088) and Pseudomonas sp. 7 (134/1,088) from each RTB larval stage from all isolation sources were higher than those of other bacteria species (Fig. 1, Supplementary, Table S1 online). Amongst these 3 bacterial species, isolation frequency of R. aquatilis (630/1,088) was the highest (Fig. 1, Supplementary, Table S1 online). Eight bacterial strains (R. aquatilis B301 B302 B904, S. liquefaciens B310 B317, Pseudomonas sp. 7 B321 B322 B911) from the 3 most frequently isolated bacterial species were used in subsequent experiments.
Nearly all high–energy density cathodes for rechargeable lithium batteries are well-ordered materials in which lithium and other cations occupy distinct sites. Cation-disordered materials are generally disregarded as cathodes because lithium diffusion tends to be limited by their structures. The performance of Li1.211Mo0.467Cr0.3O2 shows that lithium diffusion can be facile in disordered materials. Using ab initio computations, we demonstrate that this unexpected behavior is due to percolation of a certain type of active diffusion channels in disordered Li-excess materials. A unified understanding of high performance in both layered and Li-excess materials may enable the design of disordered-electrode materials with high capacity and high energy density.
